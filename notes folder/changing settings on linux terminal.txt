you learned how to change the comment color
the displayed in your 'c' files by adding the line: hi Comment ctermfg="somecolor"(you put yellow) case and spacing matter. to you .vimrc config file

you learned to change the defult color that directories are displayed in in the terminal when you type 'ls'.  here you need to copy the system DIR_COLORS file located (maybe) in the etc/profile directory to your home directory and then changes its name to ".dir_colors".  this allows your config file to override the system config here. man pages that helped with this where 
man 1 dircolors
man 5 dir_colors
