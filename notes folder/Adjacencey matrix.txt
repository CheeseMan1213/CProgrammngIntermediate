first I am going to try and do it the way I think
I understand it 
then tak a look at the teachers code

Remember that you need to be able to go across and down, so the source node need a pointer the next 
source node and to the next regular node

1. create first 2D node
2. go down adding on 1D nodes 0 to 9
3.attatch a new 2D node to the old one;
4. go down this new node 10 to 19
